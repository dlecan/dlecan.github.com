## A major release

Despite of his version number, Play2War v0.7 is really a major release of this plugin for play Framework 2: 
Servlet 2.5 containers (Tomcat 6, Jetty 7, ...) can now be used to deploy your Play applications!

But this compatibility as a price: performances. They are much worth than with Servlet 3.0, 
themselves worth than with native Play 2.

Two threads are indeed necessary to compute each request:

* one for handling HTTP request
* one for Akka asynchronous computing

Standard Java synchronization mecanisms (wait/notify) are then used to make theses threads work together. 
Of course, they are managed by threads pools, but synchronization has a cost. So if you need high performances
and have to deploy WAR packages, please upgrade to a modern servlet 3.0 container, such as Tomcat 7, 
Jetty 8, JBoss 7.x, Glassfish 3.x (not tested yet), ...

Don't forget to look at full [Changelog](https://github.com/dlecan/play2-war-plugin/wiki/Changelog).

== Upgrade your project's configuration

Switching between Servlet 2.5 and 3.0 requires configuration, so you will need to upgrade to Play project 
to be compatible with Play2War 0.7.

Here is a typical Play2 project ``project/Build.scala`` using Play2war v0.6:

```scala
import sbt._
import Keys._
import PlayProject._

object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

    val appName         = "myproject"
    val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "com.github.play2war" %% "play2-war-core" % "0.6"
    )

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
      resolvers += "Play2war plugins release" at "http://repository-play-war.forge.cloudbees.com/release/"
    )

}
```

Follow the next steps to upgrade it to play2War v0.7.

### Remove Play2War core dependency

Dependency to Plat2War core is not necessary anymore. It will be automatically setup by the plugin.

```scala Before
val appDependencies = Seq(
  "com.github.play2war" %% "play2-war-core" % "0.6"
)

...

val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
  resolvers += "Play2war plugins release" at "http://repository-play-war.forge.cloudbees.com/release/"
)
```

So, remove it.

```scala After
val appDependencies = Seq(
  // Nothing or your other dependencies
)

...

val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
  // Nothing or your other settings
)

```

### Update Play2War plugin version

As usual, update ``project/plugin.sbt``:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.play2war" % "play2-war-plugin" % "0.7")
```

### Import Play2War SBT settings

```scala
...
import PlayProject._
import com.github.play2war.plugin._
```

### Move all settings in a variable and add Play2War SBT settings to your project's settings

```scala
val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

val projectSettings = Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings ++ Seq(
  // Your settings
)

...

val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(projectSettings: _*)
```

### Configure servlet container version

```scala
val projectSettings = Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings ++ Seq(
  Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "3.0"
  // Or Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "2.5"
)

```

### Final project file

```scala
import sbt._
import Keys._
import PlayProject._
import com.github.play2war.plugin._

object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

    val appName         = "myproject"
    val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

    val projectSettings = Play2WarPlugin.play2WarSettings ++ Seq(
       Play2WarKeys.servletVersion := "3.0"
    )

    val appDependencies = Seq(
      // Nothing
    )

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(projectSettings: _*)

}
```

### Package your application

Then, package your application as usual: ``sbt package`` (or ``play package``).
