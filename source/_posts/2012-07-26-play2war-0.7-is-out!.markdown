== A major release

Despite of his version, Play2War v0.7 is really a major release of this plugin for play Framework 2: 
Servlet 2.5 containers (Tomcat 6, Jetty 7, ...) can now be used to deploy your Play applications!

But this compatibility as a price: performances. They are much worth than with Servlet 3.0, 
themselves worth than with native Play 2.

Two threads are indeed necessary to compute each request:

* one for handling HTTP request
* one for Akka asynchronous computing

Standard Java synchronization mecanisms (wait/notify) are then used to make theses threads work together. 
Of course, they are managed by threads pools, but synchronization has a cost. So if you need high performances
and have to deploy WAR packages, please upgrade to a modern servlet 3.0 container, such as Tomcat 7, 
Jetty 8, JBoss 7.x, Glassfish 3.x (not tested yet), ...

== Upgrade your project's configuration

Switching between Servlet 2.5 and 3.0 requires configuration, so you will need to upgrade to Play project 
to be compatible with Play2War 0.7.

Here is a typical Play2 project using Play2war v0.6:
