Author of [FreeFileSync](site) publishes [binaries](binaries) for Ubuntu for each release. But you have to install them again and again, once a month. That's why I am the maintainer of [FreeFileSync PPA](ppa), the way in Ubuntu to distribute binaries with automatic updates.

As of May 2014, here are the FreeFileSync versions available for each Ubuntu series:

| Ubuntu series | Last available version of FreeFileSync | Supported ? | Comment 
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- 
| Natty         | 4.0                                    | No          |         
| Oneiric       | 5.5                                    | No          |         
| Precise       | 5.21                                   | No          | Requires newer libraries 
| Quantal       | 5.23                                   | No          | Requires newer libraries 
| Raring        | 5.23                                   | No          | Requires newer libraries 
| Saucy         | 6.0                                    | Could be if asked |   
| Trusty        | 6.5                                    | Yes         |
